Once installed, the extension works automatically:

- When you start Chrome each day, the extension will select a random bookmark as your homepage.
- Opening a new tab will redirect you to the selected bookmark for that day.
- The homepage will remain the same for the entire day, changing again the next time you start Chrome.
Note: If you don't have any bookmarks, the new tab page will display a message asking you to add some bookmarks and reload.
