The Random Bookmark Homepage is a Chrome extension that enhances your browsing experience by setting a random bookmark as your homepage each day. Every time you open Chrome, you'll be greeted with a different page from your bookmarks, helping you rediscover saved content and adding an element of surprise to your daily browsing routine.

### Sending money to bank account

To transfer any of over 30 supported fiat currencies to a bank account, on the main accounts screen tap transfer (button with two arrows at the bottom of the screen) → New → Add a bank recipient. You'll be asked to add the bank transfer details for either an Individual, or a Business if you're paying a company.

### Sending money to card

Enter the details of the card you want to send money to. If you have the card at hand, you can take a picture of the front of the card or tap the back of your phone against the card to capture the card number. Hit 'Save securely' which saves the card number details so you won't have to re-enter it next time.

Enter the amount you wish to send and below the currency, you can choose from which currency balance the amount will be deducted. There is also an option to add a note to yourself, but it is not required and won't be sent to the beneficiary.
